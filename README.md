# Embedded Sentry Project

## Overview
The Embedded Sentry project is a sophisticated system designed to use accelerometer/gyro data to record and replicate hand movement sequences for unlocking resources. This project is an innovative blend of hardware control and software programming, primarily using C and C++ languages.

## Hardware and Software
- Microcontroller: Details the type and model used.
- Accelerometer/Gyro: Specifications and usage instructions.
- Software: PlatformIO and any additional libraries or dependencies.

## Features
- Record Key: Methodology for recording the hand movement sequence.
- Unlock Mechanism: Description of how the sequence unlocks the resource.
- Visual Indicators: Use of LEDs or other indicators for feedback.

## Installation and Setup
Guidelines for setting up the hardware, installing necessary software, and configuring the microcontroller.

## Usage
Step-by-step instructions on how to use the system, from recording a new sequence to unlocking the resource.
